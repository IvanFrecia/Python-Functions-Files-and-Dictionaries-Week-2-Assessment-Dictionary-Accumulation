Coursera U of M Course: Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries - Week 2 - Assessment Dictionary Accumulation - course_2_assessment_3


Question 1:

The dictionary Junior shows a schedule for a junior year semester. The key is the course name and the value is the number of credits. Find the total number of credits taken this semester and assign it to the variable credits. Do not hardcode this – use dictionary accumulation!


Question 2:

Create a dictionary, freq, that displays each character in string str1 as the key and its frequency as the value.


Question 3:

Provided is a string saved to the variable name s1. Create a dictionary named counts that contains each letter in s1 and the number of times it occurs.


Question 4:

Create a dictionary, freq_words, that contains each word in string str1 as the key and its frequency as the value.


Question 5:

Create a dictionary called wrd_d from the string sent, so that the key is a word and the value is how many times you have seen that word.


Question 6:

Create the dictionary characters that shows each character from the string sally and its frequency. Then, find the most frequent letter based on the dictionary. Assign this letter to the variable best_char.


Question 7:

Find the least frequent letter. Create the dictionary characters that shows each character from string sally and its frequency. Then, find the least frequent letter in the string and assign the letter to the variable worst_char.


Question 8:

Create a dictionary named letter_counts that contains each letter and the number of times it occurs in string1. Challenge: Letters should not be counted separately as upper-case and lower-case. Intead, all of them should be counted as lower-case.


Question 9:

Create a dictionary called low_d that keeps track of all the characters in the string p and notes how many times each character was seen. Make sure that there are no repeats of characters as keys, such that “T” and “t” are both seen as a “t” for example.
